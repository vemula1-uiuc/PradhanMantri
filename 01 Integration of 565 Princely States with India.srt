1
00:01:02,116 --> 00:01:06,500
Jinnah sahib what the princely states are joining with Pakistan,

2
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,790
what will they get from you?

3
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,791
Your highness I made my position very clear

4
00:01:12,502 --> 00:01:19,058
I'm ready to give much higher status than India

5
00:01:22,928 --> 00:01:29,009
and Your Highness, I'm signing a blank page

6
00:01:30,234 --> 00:01:36,157
to join Pakistan, whatever demands you have

7
00:01:37,026 --> 00:01:40,304
include them.

8
00:01:44,016 --> 00:01:46,819
thank you Jinnah Sahib

9
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:54,876
if Jodhpur can join with Pakistan, then allow us to use Karachi port

10
00:01:59,141 --> 00:02:05,933
free import of weapons and most importantly, with Jodhpur

11
00:02:06,053 --> 00:02:13,634
your Sindh railway line to Hyderabad must be under our control

12
00:02:13,754 --> 00:02:17,780
anything for you, Your Highness

13
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,347
Yuvraj

14
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:25,359
like Jodhpur, you will share border with us

15
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:31,480
like Jodhpur, isn't Jaisalmer not joining Pakistan?

16
00:02:32,941 --> 00:02:37,166
we can join Pakistan, Jinnah Sahib

17
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,826
but we have a condition

18
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,289
anytime in our province

19
00:02:46,881 --> 00:02:50,356
there is a fight between Hindus and Muslims

20
00:02:51,502 --> 00:02:55,095
will you remain neutral?

21
00:02:57,662 --> 00:02:59,518
what sort of question is this, Maharaja?

22
00:03:00,861 --> 00:03:07,377
Hindus and Muslims fighting is a useless thought

23
00:03:08,325 --> 00:03:15,867
Your Highness, as long as Central Govt in India is weak, we are both strong

24
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:24,713
I have signed on the dotted lines, you fill in the conditions

25
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:31,940
Im so grateful to Jinnah Sahib for such a big proposal

26
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:38,575
I... I.... I'll quickly think over & let you know my decision

27
00:03:50,303 --> 00:03:56,463
Imagine what would've happened if creator of Pakistan, Md Ali Jinnah didnt withdraw the proposal...

28
00:03:56,991 --> 00:04:01,614
India as we know today would've looked like this

29
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,786
This is that story of formation of India

30
00:04:18,906 --> 00:04:20,971
which has never been told before.

31
00:04:21,091 --> 00:04:24,169
Welcome to प्रधानमंत्री

32
00:04:24,827 --> 00:04:27,881
Prime Minister, a program in which

33
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:30,777
we relate those stories

34
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,173
which were not written in any books

35
00:04:33,976 --> 00:04:35,964
those stories of Free India

36
00:04:36,727 --> 00:04:39,623
which not heard and not understood

37
00:04:39,939 --> 00:04:43,019
we will not be able to understand our country fully

38
00:04:43,454 --> 00:04:47,047
to start the first episode, lets go pre-independence

39
00:04:48,061 --> 00:04:50,207
June 3, 1947

40
00:04:51,233 --> 00:04:53,353
how will free India look like?

41
00:04:53,473 --> 00:04:55,287
this issue was decided on that day

42
00:04:58,736 --> 00:05:01,948
on June 3, 1947, Delhi All-India Radio

43
00:05:01,976 --> 00:05:03,123
hustle and bustle increased

44
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,889
Viceroy of Governor-General

45
00:05:07,247 --> 00:05:09,469
Louis Mountbatten was expected to arrive

46
00:05:10,178 --> 00:05:11,963
Lord Mountbatten arrived in the evening

47
00:05:11,964 --> 00:05:15,207
he was accompanied by Jawaharlal Nehru

48
00:05:15,327 --> 00:05:18,131
and the leader of Sikhs, Sardar Baldev Singh

49
00:05:18,738 --> 00:05:21,367
and for muslims, India's secessionist...

50
00:05:21,652 --> 00:05:23,295
demanding separate nation,

51
00:05:23,565 --> 00:05:26,083
Mohammed Ali Jinnah

52
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:29,369
It has been impossible to obtain

53
00:05:29,411 --> 00:05:31,526
full agreement on any plan

54
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:36,085
that would preserve the unity of India

55
00:05:37,165 --> 00:05:43,180
there can be no question of coercive any large areas in which one community

56
00:05:43,201 --> 00:05:49,972
as a majority to live against their will under a government

57
00:05:50,071 --> 00:05:54,008
in which another community has the majority

58
00:05:55,277 --> 00:05:59,515
the only alternative to coercion...

59
00:06:00,241 --> 00:06:01,750
is...

60
00:06:05,552 --> 00:06:07,412
partition!

61
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,609
after independence, two separate countries will be formed...

62
00:06:15,065 --> 00:06:18,824
this was declared by Viceroy Lord Mountbatten

63
00:06:18,944 --> 00:06:24,479
and Congress approval was declared on radio by Jawaharlal Nehru

64
00:06:25,743 --> 00:06:29,187
for Nehru, it was a very emotional subject

65
00:06:31,998 --> 00:06:36,737
I'm not pleased with partitioning of India

66
00:06:37,148 --> 00:06:42,677
but at this moment, it is only possible solution

67
00:06:43,697 --> 00:06:52,385
any region of India existing separately from the union is very sorrowful to all

68
00:06:54,508 --> 00:07:00,579
but still, I've arrived at this decision with long term view ahead

69
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:03,887
the proposed solution is acceptable

70
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:09,712
which united India we fought and worked for...

71
00:07:09,832 --> 00:07:18,696
to keep India united by partitioning into two countries, was called the "Mountbatten Plan"

72
00:07:18,898 --> 00:07:24,007
but, with this Mountbatten Plan, many people were going to be worried

73
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,036
about shattering and scattering of India

74
00:07:26,061 --> 00:07:27,446
and division of India

75
00:07:27,566 --> 00:07:29,217
who could see this

76
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:33,057
but then just one day after the declaration

77
00:07:33,367 --> 00:07:37,115
this story took a big turn

78
00:07:39,309 --> 00:07:41,400
June 4, 1947

79
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:48,416
Lord Mountbatten called for press conference at the Legislative Assembly/Parliament

80
00:07:48,678 --> 00:07:54,886
and significance of this press conference could be estimated

81
00:07:55,006 --> 00:08:01,567
from the fact that on June 3, Lord Mountbatten was preparing mock drill late night

82
00:08:02,376 --> 00:08:10,156
300 reporters from all over the world assembled to ask Lord Mountbatten regarding the future of India

83
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:30,898
I sincerely mean it, when I say that power will be transferred completely by 1947

84
00:08:31,732 --> 00:08:42,701
the date of transfer of power by Britain to India will be around August 1947

85
00:08:43,561 --> 00:08:52,508
I've already bought my steamer ticket for Aug 15, so this will be date of transfer

86
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:05,524
this was shocking news because British were expected to leave India by June 1948

87
00:09:05,644 --> 00:09:14,547
and now Mountbatten declared that within 72 days partitioning and independence will be completed

88
00:09:14,951 --> 00:09:25,162
Independence date was certain now but a big question arose from this declaration

89
00:09:25,616 --> 00:09:37,419
without the answer independence was worthless...
How many nations were being freed- 2 or 565?

90
00:09:43,965 --> 00:09:47,680
15 August 1947

91
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:58,595
15 August 1947, two countries were becoming independent. 2 or 565?

92
00:10:00,496 --> 00:10:04,620
these details are not usually found in history books

93
00:10:05,712 --> 00:10:08,947
but just few days before independence

94
00:10:09,493 --> 00:10:16,024
Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru & Sardar Patel were facing two big problems

95
00:10:16,934 --> 00:10:21,180
first one, how to stop communal violence?

96
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:29,045
and the second, how to prevent distortion of beauty of India's shape?

97
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:34,323
the reason for second problem was "Lapse of Paramountcy"

98
00:10:37,215 --> 00:10:43,078
on one hand we thought that the British had united entire India

99
00:10:44,169 --> 00:10:47,950
then how does the talk of 565 nation states come from?

100
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:58,667
actually, the British India included small, medium, big princely states totalling about 565

101
00:10:58,787 --> 00:11:08,877
these states were indirectly governed by the British; some kings had their own laws, police, armies & even currencies

102
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:16,601
these states had accepted the eminence and superiority of British throne, called Paramountcy

103
00:11:16,721 --> 00:11:21,535
so when British were leaving, they declared that this Paramountcy also ended

104
00:11:21,778 --> 00:11:29,320
