1
00:01:02,116 --> 00:01:06,500
Jinnah sahib those princely states which are joining Pakistan,

2
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,790
what will they get from you?

3
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,791
Your highness I made my position very clear

4
00:01:12,502 --> 00:01:19,058
I'm ready to give much higher status than India

5
00:01:22,928 --> 00:01:29,009
and Your Highness, I'm signing a blank page

6
00:01:30,234 --> 00:01:36,157
to join Pakistan, whatever demands you have

7
00:01:37,026 --> 00:01:40,304
include them.

8
00:01:44,016 --> 00:01:46,819
thank you Jinnah Sahib

9
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:54,876
if Jodhpur can join with Pakistan, then allow us to use Karachi port

10
00:01:59,141 --> 00:02:05,933
free import of weapons and most importantly, with Jodhpur

11
00:02:06,053 --> 00:02:13,634
your Sindh railway line to Hyderabad must be under our control

12
00:02:13,754 --> 00:02:17,780
anything for you, Your Highness

13
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,347
Yuvraj

14
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:25,359
like Jodhpur, you will share border with us

15
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:31,480
like Jodhpur, isn't Jaisalmer not joining Pakistan?

16
00:02:32,941 --> 00:02:37,166
we can join Pakistan, Jinnah Sahib

17
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,826
but we have a condition

18
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,289
anytime in our province

19
00:02:46,881 --> 00:02:50,356
there is a fight between Hindus and Muslims

20
00:02:51,502 --> 00:02:55,095
will you remain neutral?

21
00:02:57,662 --> 00:02:59,518
what sort of question is this, Maharaja?

22
00:03:00,861 --> 00:03:07,377
Hindus and Muslims fighting is a useless thought

23
00:03:08,325 --> 00:03:15,867
Your Highness, as long as Central Govt in India is weak, we are both strong

24
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:24,713
I have signed on the dotted lines, you fill in the conditions

25
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:31,940
Im so grateful to Jinnah Sahib for such a big proposal

26
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:38,575
I... I.... I'll quickly think over & let you know my decision

27
00:03:50,303 --> 00:03:56,463
Imagine what would've happened if creator of Pakistan, Md Ali Jinnah didnt withdraw the proposal...

28
00:03:56,991 --> 00:04:01,614
India as we know today would've looked like this

29
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,786
This is that story of formation of India

30
00:04:18,906 --> 00:04:20,971
which has never been told before.

31
00:04:21,091 --> 00:04:24,169
Welcome to प्रधानमंत्री

32
00:04:24,827 --> 00:04:27,881
Prime Minister, a program in which

33
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:30,777
we relate those stories

34
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,173
which were not written in any books

35
00:04:33,976 --> 00:04:35,964
those stories of Free India

36
00:04:36,727 --> 00:04:39,623
which not heard and not understood

37
00:04:39,939 --> 00:04:43,019
we will not be able to understand our country fully

38
00:04:43,454 --> 00:04:47,047
to start the first episode, lets go pre-independence

39
00:04:48,061 --> 00:04:50,207
June 3, 1947

40
00:04:51,233 --> 00:04:53,353
how will free India look like?

41
00:04:53,473 --> 00:04:55,287
this issue was decided on that day

42
00:04:58,736 --> 00:05:01,948
on June 3, 1947, Delhi All-India Radio

43
00:05:01,976 --> 00:05:03,123
hustle and bustle increased

44
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,889
Viceroy of Governor-General

45
00:05:07,247 --> 00:05:09,469
Louis Mountbatten was expected to arrive

46
00:05:10,178 --> 00:05:11,963
Lord Mountbatten arrived in the evening

47
00:05:11,964 --> 00:05:15,207
he was accompanied by Jawaharlal Nehru

48
00:05:15,327 --> 00:05:18,131
and the leader of Sikhs, Sardar Baldev Singh

49
00:05:18,738 --> 00:05:21,367
and for muslims, India's secessionist...

50
00:05:21,652 --> 00:05:23,295
demanding separate nation,

51
00:05:23,565 --> 00:05:26,083
Mohammed Ali Jinnah

52
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:29,369
It has been impossible to obtain

53
00:05:29,411 --> 00:05:31,526
full agreement on any plan

54
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:36,085
that would preserve the unity of India

55
00:05:37,165 --> 00:05:43,180
there can be no question of coercive any large areas in which one community

56
00:05:43,201 --> 00:05:49,972
as a majority to live against their will under a government

57
00:05:50,071 --> 00:05:54,008
in which another community has the majority

58
00:05:55,277 --> 00:05:59,515
the only alternative to coercion...

59
00:06:00,241 --> 00:06:01,750
is...

60
00:06:05,552 --> 00:06:07,412
partition!

61
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,609
after independence, two separate countries will be formed...

62
00:06:15,065 --> 00:06:18,824
this was declared by Viceroy Lord Mountbatten

63
00:06:18,944 --> 00:06:24,479
and Congress approval was declared on radio by Jawaharlal Nehru

64
00:06:25,743 --> 00:06:29,187
for Nehru, it was a very emotional subject

65
00:06:31,998 --> 00:06:36,737
I'm not pleased with partitioning of India

66
00:06:37,148 --> 00:06:42,677
but at this moment, it is only possible solution

67
00:06:43,697 --> 00:06:52,385
any region of India existing separately from the union is very sorrowful to all

68
00:06:54,508 --> 00:07:00,579
but still, I've arrived at this decision with long term view ahead

69
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:03,887
the proposed solution is acceptable

70
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:09,712
which united India we fought and worked for...

71
00:07:09,832 --> 00:07:18,696
to keep India united by partitioning into two countries, was called the "Mountbatten Plan"

72
00:07:18,898 --> 00:07:24,007
but, with this Mountbatten Plan, many people were going to be worried

73
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,036
about shattering and scattering of India

74
00:07:26,061 --> 00:07:27,446
and division of India

75
00:07:27,566 --> 00:07:29,217
who could see this

76
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:33,057
but then just one day after the declaration

77
00:07:33,367 --> 00:07:37,115
this story took a big turn

78
00:07:39,309 --> 00:07:41,400
June 4, 1947

79
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:48,416
Lord Mountbatten called for press conference at the Legislative Assembly/Parliament

80
00:07:48,678 --> 00:07:54,886
and significance of this press conference could be estimated

81
00:07:55,006 --> 00:08:01,567
from the fact that on June 3, Lord Mountbatten was preparing mock drill late night

82
00:08:02,376 --> 00:08:10,156
300 reporters from all over the world assembled to ask Lord Mountbatten regarding the future of India

83
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:30,898
I sincerely mean it, when I say that power will be transferred completely by 1947

84
00:08:31,732 --> 00:08:42,701
the date of transfer of power by Britain to India will be around August 1947

85
00:08:43,561 --> 00:08:52,508
I've already bought my steamer ticket for Aug 15, so this will be date of transfer

86
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:05,524
this was shocking news because British were expected to leave India by June 1948

87
00:09:05,644 --> 00:09:14,547
and now Mountbatten declared that within 72 days partitioning and independence will be completed

88
00:09:14,951 --> 00:09:25,162
Independence date was certain now but a big question arose from this declaration

89
00:09:25,616 --> 00:09:37,419
without the answer independence was worthless...
How many nations were being freed- 2 or 565?

90
00:09:43,965 --> 00:09:47,680
15 August 1947

91
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:58,595
15 August 1947, two countries were becoming independent. 2 or 565?

92
00:10:00,496 --> 00:10:04,620
these details are not usually found in history books

93
00:10:05,712 --> 00:10:08,947
but just few days before independence

94
00:10:09,493 --> 00:10:16,024
Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru & Sardar Patel were facing two big problems

95
00:10:16,934 --> 00:10:21,180
first one, how to stop communal violence?

96
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:29,045
and the second, how to prevent distortion of beauty of India's shape?

97
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:34,323
the reason for second problem was "Lapse of Paramountcy"

98
00:10:37,215 --> 00:10:43,078
on one hand we thought that the British had united entire India

99
00:10:44,169 --> 00:10:47,950
then how does the talk of 565 nation states come from?

100
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:58,667
actually, the British India included small, medium, big princely states totalling about 565

101
00:10:58,787 --> 00:11:08,877
these states were indirectly governed by the British; some kings had their own laws, police, armies & even currencies

102
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:16,601
these states had accepted the eminence and superiority of British throne, called Paramountcy

103
00:11:16,721 --> 00:11:21,535
so when British were leaving, they declared that this Paramountcy also ended

104
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:26,285
every princely state was free to decide its future

105
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:29,319
today's Rajasthan was home to Sirohi state

106
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:36,101
Raghuveer Singh, current successor of Sirohi State, remembers the events of 1947

107
00:11:36,672 --> 00:11:41,331
when the British arrived, we made a treaty

108
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:50,179
what was the context of treaty between Indian states and the British

109
00:11:50,822 --> 00:11:56,736
for eg, Sirohi state signed treaty with British in September 1823

110
00:11:57,292 --> 00:12:04,596
it states that its a treaty between two sovereign states

111
00:12:05,582 --> 00:12:14,757
a treaty of friendship between states of equal status

112
00:12:15,464 --> 00:12:21,909
that Sirohi state will respect British rule & British rule will respect Sirohi state

113
00:12:22,029 --> 00:12:25,852
they wont interfere in each others administration

114
00:12:26,122 --> 00:12:33,419
and that British guarantees peace in India, between Sirohi state & its neighbors

115
00:12:33,539 --> 00:12:36,673
I praise them even though they were foreigners because

116
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,675
when British parliament passed the Indian Independence act

117
00:12:42,097 --> 00:12:44,259
they were 100% fair

118
00:12:45,087 --> 00:12:46,379
what was enacted?

119
00:12:46,835 --> 00:12:50,644
our treaty rights with Indian states are hereby terminated

120
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:53,841
and they revert to status quo ante

121
00:12:54,544 --> 00:12:59,720
situation for princely states returned to how it was before the treaty

122
00:13:00,258 --> 00:13:02,751
ie they become sovereign independent states

123
00:13:03,414 --> 00:13:07,223
they did not betray us, I dont think

124
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,352
treaty, agreements and alliances are all good but

125
00:13:12,619 --> 00:13:15,890
British had full authority over princely states

126
00:13:17,182 --> 00:13:20,279
and before leaving, they changed their stance

127
00:13:21,795 --> 00:13:27,360
British declared that states who want to be independent, can be free

128
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:32,429
what this meant is that we were getting independence but

129
00:13:32,917 --> 00:13:34,681
country was shattering

130
00:13:35,112 --> 00:13:38,566
and creator of Pakistan, Md Ali Jinnah

131
00:13:39,021 --> 00:13:41,266
took full advantage of this situation

132
00:13:46,872 --> 00:13:50,524
Sir, Nehru and Congress are not in favor of rights of states

133
00:13:51,203 --> 00:13:52,818
what the opinion of Muslim League?

134
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:59,724
Nehru has a bad habit of day-dreaming

135
00:14:03,186 --> 00:14:06,151
for us, lapse of Paramountcy implies that

136
00:14:07,873 --> 00:14:11,683
you can choose to stay in India or Pakistan

137
00:14:13,273 --> 00:14:15,542
or if you want to be free, remain independent

138
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:19,773
geographical proximity

139
00:14:20,941 --> 00:14:23,483
referendum makes no sense

140
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,529
like what Congress is saying

141
00:14:27,782 --> 00:14:29,107
whatever decision

142
00:14:30,076 --> 00:14:30,747
rulers make,

143
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:33,032
Nawabs make

144
00:14:34,429 --> 00:14:36,500
Britain's treaties were with them

145
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:43,908
Jinnah encouraged princely states to rebel

146
00:14:44,168 --> 00:14:47,758
his objective was to keep India weak forever

147
00:14:48,422 --> 00:14:55,039
and in this situation, there was only one person who could help India, that is Lord Mountbatten

148
00:14:56,635 --> 00:15:03,253
actually, Viceroy Mountbatten was a futurist & he was very worried about

149
00:15:03,609 --> 00:15:11,422
his reputation with future generations. Bloodshed was rampant since before declaration of partition

150
00:15:11,988 --> 00:15:16,177
5000 people were murdered in Kolkata city alone

151
00:15:16,776 --> 00:15:22,599
Mountbatten felt that history will blame him for this bloodshed

152
00:15:23,602 --> 00:15:29,603
VP Menon was advisor to Viceroy & Menon understood Mountbatten's pain

153
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:36,688
Menon described in his book "Story of Integration of Indian States"

154
00:15:38,933 --> 00:15:43,223
"I told Mountbatten that he can try to heal the wounds of partitioning"

155
00:15:44,329 --> 00:15:47,590
"by helping with the merger of princely states with India"

156
00:15:49,778 --> 00:15:53,418
"and future generations will see him as the person who united India"

157
00:15:56,223 --> 00:16:00,646
I think this advice made Mountbatten better

158
00:16:05,508 --> 00:16:11,668
Sir, already 8000 people died even before we declared the transfer of power, and

159
00:16:12,379 --> 00:16:18,895
if we dont try to stop this, not just the current but even future generations will hold us responsible

160
00:16:19,448 --> 00:16:29,013
Sir, the riots right now are in Punjab and Bengal only. What would happen if they spread to princely states?

161
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:37,158
Sir, I'd suggest that you intervene and stop further fragmentation

162
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:43,364
you are suggesting that I transfer 560 princely states to the dominion of India?

163
00:16:44,114 --> 00:16:50,235
I dont think that Sardar Patel, or Nehru or any other leader would accept these propositions

164
00:16:51,183 --> 00:17:00,345
Sir, as far as I understand the Indian leaders, no one will object to your role

165
00:17:00,977 --> 00:17:05,400
infact to keep India intact, they may be willing to do anything

166
00:17:06,308 --> 00:17:18,234
Sir, if you succeed in merging these kings with India, then our India's future will be strong

167
00:17:18,715 --> 00:17:23,499
and we will always be remember you for your help

168
00:17:24,934 --> 00:17:25,980
let me think

169
00:17:32,062 --> 00:17:39,148
soon, Viceroy Mountbatten agreed to help & Sardar Patel had a meeting with him.

170
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:44,868
on the other hand, Nehru got consent from interim Cabinet for Viceroy Mountbatten to

171
00:17:44,988 --> 00:17:49,656
...act as an intermediary between Indian Govt & princely states

172
00:17:50,209 --> 00:18:01,459
because Viceroy was member of British Royal family, rulers of Indian states wanted to maintain close ties amd friendship

173
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:07,019
and they would rely on him more than any other Governor-General or Viceroy

174
00:18:08,131 --> 00:18:10,987
Lord Mountbatten formally took India's side

175
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:24,534
this made India's position much stronger; but VP Menon, who had advised Mountbatten, was unsettled

176
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:34,517
the country is becoming free and you want to seek retirement?

177
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:48,948
Sir, I've been working for 30 years. I never imagined to live in independent India!

178
00:18:52,268 --> 00:18:59,858
and now the dream is coming true, So I want to retire.

179
00:19:01,462 --> 00:19:09,731
as you are well aware, I spent all my life serving the British Govt

180
00:19:11,767 --> 00:19:26,823


181
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:41,015
this moment is not the time to step aside or retire. Sir! dont you have 100% trust/confidence in us?

182
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:54,590
Menon, do you understand British is leaving India in same condition like it was before they arrived

183
00:19:56,071 --> 00:20:04,339
a broken & scattered India? How many kings rule from Kashmir to Kanyakumari?

184
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:10,880
about 540 to 560

185
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:20,876
what is their stance? Hundreds of these kingdoms dream to become independent nation. They want English.

186
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:31,147
they accept being slaves to British but sitting across with us, they feel insulted. Such people cannot participate in deciding the destiny of India.

187
00:20:31,345 --> 00:20:35,961
and remember one thing, the entire country is becoming independent on Aug 15, 1947

188
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:42,606
but to combine the country from Kashmir to Kanyakumari as a single thread we must do it together

189
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:52,943
To unite the nation from Kashmir to Kanyakumari was the biggest challenge

190
00:20:53,727 --> 00:21:02,017
Many larger princely states among the total 565 wanted to become independent nations

191
00:21:02,638 --> 00:21:10,181
they feared the proposed democracy, since they will lose their complete freedom

192
00:21:10,773 --> 00:21:22,146
Under supervion of Sardar Patel, Jawaharlal Nehru & Mountbatten, VP Menon prepared the Instrument of Accession

193
00:21:22,502 --> 00:21:27,556
kings and rulers were told to first sign this document
